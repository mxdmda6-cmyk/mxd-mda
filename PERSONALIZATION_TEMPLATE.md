1. Create a folder: `images/`
2. Name photos: `year-1.jpg`, `year-2.jpg`, etc.
3. Optimal size: 800x800px or larger
4. Format: JPG or PNG

### If you need help with photos:
- I can create placeholder designs
- You can use Canva to create collages (see CANVA_GUIDE.md)
- Photos can be added later - card works great with text only!

## 💡 Tips for Great Memories

**Keep it personal**:
- Specific moments > general statements
- Include details (dates, places, feelings)
- Mention inside jokes or family traditions
- Use language your son will recognize

**Vary the tone**:
- Some funny, some sentimental
- Mix big events with small moments
- Include accomplishments and growth
- Don't forget the silly stuff!

**Make #16 special**:
- This is the big reveal
- Include hopes for the future
- Express how proud you are
- Tie in the Day of the Dead theme

**Length guidelines**:
- Minimum: 1-2 sentences (brief is okay!)
- Recommended: 2-4 sentences (sweet spot)
- Maximum: 6-8 sentences (for special years)
