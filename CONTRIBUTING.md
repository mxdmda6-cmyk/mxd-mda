# Contributing Guide

## Setup
1. Fork or branch from `main` (preferred for team members).
2. Install dependencies for your stack (Python / Node).
3. Run tests locally before pushing.

## Workflow
- Create a feature branch: `feature/<short-topic>` or `fix/<short-topic>`.
- Commit with conventional style, e.g., `feat: add scene renderer`.
- Open a Pull Request to `main`.
- Ensure status checks pass; request at least one review.

## Tests
- Put tests under `tests/`.
- Aim for clear, deterministic tests.
