## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "The automated script isn't working"

**Solution:** Use manual setup instead. Just copy the `Documents` folder into your Google Drive.

### "I don't know where Google Drive Desktop saves files"

**Common locations:**
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\[YourName]\Google Drive\My Drive`
- **Mac:** `/Users/[YourName]/Google Drive/My Drive`
- **Linux:** `/home/[YourName]/Google Drive`

Can't find it? Open Google Drive Desktop app → Settings → Folder location

### "Folders aren't syncing to the cloud"

**Check:**
1. Google Drive icon in system tray/menu bar
2. Click icon → "Sync status"
3. Pause & Resume if stuck
4. Check internet connection
5. Check available storage space (you have 2TB!)

### "I already have a Documents folder in Google Drive"

**The setup script handles this!** It will ask if you want to:
1. Merge with existing (recommended - won't overwrite files)
2. Rename existing to `Documents_OLD` and create fresh
3. Cancel and manually organize

---

## 📱 MOBILE ACCESS

### Add to Home Screen (Recommended):

1. Open Google Drive app on phone
2. Navigate to `Documents` folder
3. Tap ⋮ (three dots)
4. Select "Add to Home screen"
5. Now you have one-tap access! 📲

### Upload from Phone:

1. Take photo of document
2. Open Google Drive app
3. Navigate to correct folder
4. Tap **+** → Upload
5. Select photo
6. Rename before uploading (use voice typing!)

**Example:**
- Photo of court summons
- Upload to `06_Legal/Court_Case_27-CR-25-22797/`
- Rename: `2025-11-01_Court_Summons_Photo.jpg`

## 🔐 SECURITY & BACKUP

### Google Drive Provides:
- ✅ Automatic cloud backup
- ✅ 30-day trash recovery
- ✅ Version history (restore old versions)
- ✅ 2-factor authentication (enable in settings!)
- ✅ Selective sharing (share specific folders only)

### Recommended Settings:

1. **Enable 2-factor authentication:**
   - Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification

2. **Don't share entire Documents folder:**
   - Only share specific subfolders when needed
   - Example: Share `06_Legal/Court_Case_XX/` with your lawyer

3. **Check trash periodically:**
   - Accidentally deleted something? Check Trash
   - You have 30 days before permanent deletion
