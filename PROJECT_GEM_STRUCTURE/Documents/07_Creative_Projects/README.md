## 💡 Creative Organization Tips

### 1. **Separate Work-in-Progress from Finals**
Create temporary `_WIP/` folders in each project for active work.
Move to final location when done.

### 2. **Use Version Numbers Religiously**
Don't end up with:
```
logo_final.png
logo_final_v2.png
logo_final_FINAL.png
logo_final_USE_THIS_ONE.png
```

Instead:
```
MXD_MDA_Logo_v1.png
MXD_MDA_Logo_v2.png
MXD_MDA_Logo_v3_Final.png
```

### 3. **Archive Aggressively**
If you haven't touched it in 3 months, archive it.
Keep active projects lean and focused.

### 4. **Link Related Files**
Create a `_LINKS.txt` file in project folders:
```
Related Files:
- Brand Guide: [Google Drive link]
- Marketing Plan: [Google Drive link]
- Content Calendar: [Google Sheets link]
- Notion Dashboard: [Notion link]
```

### 5. **Regular Project Reviews**
Set calendar reminder:
- Weekly: Review each project's status
- Monthly: Archive completed work
- Quarterly: Assess priorities, pivot if needed

## 🎨 Creative Freedom Within Structure

**Remember:**

This structure is a **framework**, not a prison.

If a project needs different organization, adapt it.
If a folder doesn't make sense, change it.
If you outgrow this structure, evolve it.

**The goal:**
- Spend less time looking for files
- Spend more time creating
- Keep creative work separate from life admin chaos

**This folder is YOUR space.**

The rest of the Documents folder handles life.
This folder handles **your creative empire**.

---

## 🌟 From Chaos to Carnival

**Before:**
- Creative files buried in random folders
- Brand work mixed with court documents
- Can't find the latest logo version
- Story drafts scattered across devices

**After:**
- Clean separation: life admin vs creative work
- Every project has dedicated space
- Clear workflows for each type of creation
- Easy to find, easy to share, easy to evolve

**This is how you build an empire:**
Not by having perfect files.
By having **organized creativity**.
