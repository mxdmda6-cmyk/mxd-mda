# 🚀 Getting Started with MXD-MDA Operations Hub

**Welcome to your central command center for transmedia empire building!**

This repository is your **operational backbone** — where strategy meets execution.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

The MXD-MDA GitHub repository serves as:
- **Strategic Planning Hub** — Your 5-year roadmap, OKRs, and sprint calendars
- **Production Control Center** — Project checklists, asset tracking, workflows
- **Technical Infrastructure** — AI agent code, automation scripts, tools
- **Single Source of Truth** — The Master Map that connects all your systems

---

## 🗺️ Start Here: The Essential Three

### 1. PROJECT_MASTER_MAP.md — Your Compass 🧭
**Location:** `docs/PROJECT_MASTER_MAP.md`

**Purpose:** The SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for where EVERYTHING lives.

**When to use:**
- ✅ Before creating any new folder or file
- ✅ When you can't find an asset
- ✅ When onboarding a new collaborator
- ✅ Weekly, during your review ritual

**Golden Rule:** If it's not in the Master Map, it doesn't officially exist.

---

### 2. Q4_2025_SPRINT_CALENDAR.md — Your Timeline ⏰
**Location:** `docs/operations/Q4_2025_SPRINT_CALENDAR.md`

**Purpose:** Your day-by-day roadmap to Q4 2025 milestones.

**When to use:**
- ✅ Every Monday morning (plan your week)
- ✅ Every Friday evening (weekly review)
- ✅ When you feel lost or overwhelmed (what's the priority TODAY?)

**Golden Rule:** If it's not on the sprint calendar, it's not part of the current plan.

---

### 3. CONSOLIDATION_ROADMAP.md — Your Cleanup Plan 🗂️
**Location:** `docs/CONSOLIDATION_ROADMAP.md`

**Purpose:** The 4-hour sprint to eliminate duplicate folders and chaos.

**When to use:**
- ✅ IMMEDIATELY (if you haven't consolidated yet)
- ✅ Weekly audit (prevent future duplicates)
- ✅ When you discover new scattered assets

**Golden Rule:** One canonical location per project. Archive duplicates; never delete.

## 🎬 Quick Start: Your First 30 Minutes

### Step 1: Read the Master Map (10 minutes)
Open `docs/PROJECT_MASTER_MAP.md` and skim it.

**Key sections:**
- Where does Google Drive stuff live?
- Where does Notion stuff live?
- Where's the Where's Crow production checklist?

---

### Step 2: Check Today's Sprint Focus (5 minutes)
Open `docs/operations/Q4_2025_SPRINT_CALENDAR.md`

Find today's date. What's the priority?

---

### Step 3: Open Your Primary Project Checklist (10 minutes)
For most people right now, that's:
`docs/projects/wheres-crow/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md`

Skim the checklist. Where are you? What's next?

---

### Step 4: Set Up Your Workspace (5 minutes)
Bookmark these locations:
- [ ] This GitHub repo
- [ ] PROJECT_MASTER_MAP.md (direct link)
- [ ] Q4_2025_SPRINT_CALENDAR.md (direct link)
- [ ] Your Notion Master Hub (add link after creating)
- [ ] Your Google Drive Master Folder (add link after consolidation)

---

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

### Every Morning:
1. **Check Sprint Calendar** — What's today's focus?
2. **Review Project Checklist** — What specific tasks are due today?
3. **Time Block Your Day** — Assign role-based blocks (e.g., 9-12 = Production work)

### Throughout the Day:
1. **Check Master Map** — Before creating any new folder/file
2. **Update Checklists** — Check off completed items in real-time (not batched!)
3. **Commit to Git** — Push code/docs regularly (don't wait until end of day)

### Every Evening:
1. **Update Task Tracker** — Move tasks forward in Notion
2. **Prep Tomorrow** — Know your top 3 priorities for next day
3. **Rest** — Step away; protect your energy

---

## 📅 Weekly Workflow

### Every Friday:
1. **Weekly Review Ritual** — Use template in `docs/operations/WEEKLY_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md`
2. **Update Sprint Calendar** — Did this week go as planned? Adjust next week.
3. **Audit Infrastructure** — Check for duplicate folders (Google Drive, Notion, local files)
4. **Celebrate Progress** — Acknowledge what got done!

### Every Monday:
1. **Plan the Week** — Review sprint calendar, set top 3 priorities
2. **Batch Role Work** — Assign specific days to specific roles (e.g., Tue/Wed = deep coding)
3. **Check Blockers** — Any obstacles from last week still present?

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Creating Duplicate Folders
**Solution:** ALWAYS check PROJECT_MASTER_MAP.md first!

### Pitfall 2: Scattered Documents
**Solution:** Use the canonical locations defined in the Master Map.

### Pitfall 3: Losing Track of Tasks
**Solution:** Update checklists in REAL-TIME, not at end of week.

### Pitfall 4: Overcommitting to Timeline
**Solution:** Use sprint calendar's "burnout check" every week. Adjust scope EARLY.

### Pitfall 5: Not Committing to Git
**Solution:** Commit frequently. Push daily. Don't let local files diverge.
