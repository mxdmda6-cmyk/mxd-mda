## 🚨 Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Manuscript not ready by Nov 8 | MEDIUM | HIGH | Reduce scope; focus on core scenes only |
| MVP too complex, can't finish in Dec | HIGH | CRITICAL | Cut features to bare minimum (1 scene, basic interaction) |
| No funding for professional art | MEDIUM | HIGH | Use placeholder art for Kickstarter; fund art post-campaign |
| Kickstarter fails to reach goal | MEDIUM | CRITICAL | Build email list NOW; validate concept with 500+ engaged subscribers |
| Burnout during sprint | HIGH | HIGH | Protect rest days; batch work by role; ask for help |

**Contingency Plans:**
- If manuscript isn't perfect by Nov 8 → Lock "good enough" version, revise in Q1 2026
- If MVP too ambitious → Launch with static mockup/video instead of full interactive demo
- If Kickstarter underfunds → Self-publish print edition, use pre-orders to fund art
- If burnout hits → Pause, reassess scope, extend timeline (better late than burned out)
